IronFlow is a **lightweight, modular, and scalable PHP framework**, designed to give developers full control over their applications while maintaining clean architecture, performance, and maintainability.

## Philosophy

- **Modularity**: activate only the modules you need to keep your projects lean and flexible.  
- **Separation of concerns**: clear MVC-based architecture ensures maintainable and understandable code.  
- **Scalability**: built to grow with your application, from small prototypes to enterprise-grade platforms.  
- **Lightweight core**: minimal dependencies and optimized for speed, letting you focus on building features.
